        # By default, Eureka uses the client heartbeat to determine if a client is up. Unless specified otherwise, the Discovery Client 
        # does not propagate the current health check status of the application, per the Spring Boot Actuator. Consequently, after 
        # successful registration, Eureka always announces that the application is in 'UP' state. This behavior can be altered by enabling 
        # Eureka health checks, which results in propagating application status to Eureka. As a consequence, every other application does 
        # not send traffic to applications in states other then 'UP'. The following example shows how to enable health checks for the 
        # client:
        # healthcheck: enabled: true
